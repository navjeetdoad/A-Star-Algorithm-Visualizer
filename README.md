# A-Star-Algorithm-Visualizer

This is a Python program that lets us plot a start point, an end point and walls on a 2-D grid, and gives us the shortest path between the 2 points, using the A Star search algorithm in order to do so. The first 2 points that are put down are the start point and the end point, and all the subsequent points that are put down are the walls. The input keys are as follows:

Press LEFT CLICK to put down the start point, end point and walls. <br />
Press RIGHT CLICK to erase the start point, end point and walls. <br />
Press the SPACE Key to start the traversal between the 2 points. <br />
Press the C Key to clear the board. <br />

An example of the program is shown below.

As we can see, the program searches from the start point to the end point, traversing around any walls in the way in order to find the shortest path.
